## Intro

This is a project that showcases the hometowns of some of Practicum's employees. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

## Description

The project combines the use of HTML,CSS with pixel perfect layout using media qurey while using the BEM method.
Built without the use of external directories except the normalize.css file.

## Figma

## Dependencies

None.

## Installing

No additional installation is required beyond taking or using NPM.

## Executing program

Live-server is recommended

## Images

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!
